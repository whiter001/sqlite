I assume that the Module doesn't know how to &quot;manage&quot; PSCustomObject ?\r<br />\n<br />\nAnother point is that the more rows are inserted the slower it goes. For example, the first scan generate around 2300 rows, it takes 1 minute to insert the first 100 rows, and almost 30minutes to insert the first 1200 rows. The entire operation will last almost 1hour :/ Is there a workaround ?\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards,\r<br />\nKarrakis<br />\n",
