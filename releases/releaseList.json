    "Description": "A wrap-up of fixes and features since the 1.0 release.\n\n* database connections now persists for the life of the SQLite drive with which they are associated.  this fixes issues related to using transactions and locked files.\n\n* the invoke-item cmdlet is supported on the drive and table nodes.  in both cases, the sql must be supplied in the dynamic -sql parameter added to the invoke-item cmdlet.  for instance:\n\n{code:powershell}\ninvoke-item db:/files -sql \"select * from files order by length\"\n{code:powershell}\n* when a table is created using the new-item cmdlet on the root node and the table spec does not contain a primary key field, a primary key field is inserted automatically.\n\n!! Notes\n\nArchive download updated on 7.3.2012 to fix incorrect framework version.",
