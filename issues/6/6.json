    "Description": "I am trying to use the transaction example code from the documentation. When I attempt any new-item inside the transaction I get an error. I ran a simplified (non-looping) command and got the following error:\r\n\r\nNew-Item : The database file is locked\r\ndatabase is locked\r\nAt line:1 char:9\r\n+ new-item <<<<  mydb:\\Users -username \"scooby\" -userid 14 -UseTransaction\r\n    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [New-Item], SQLiteException\r\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteException,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.NewItemCommand\r\n\r\nWin 7x64 \r\npowershell 2.0\r\n\r\nLet me know if I can provide any more information.",

    {
      "Message": "Confirmed.  \r\n\r\nThis is likely caused by the way the provider connects/reconnects to the database during transactions.  This does not happen when using a memory-only database, so it's almost certainly a reconnection issue.\r\n\r\nAt the moment there is no workaround; however I'll pull together a 1.1 release containing this fix in the next week or so.",
